His dad is his role model and he enjoys playing video games with friends on the weekend. His grandma keeps him motivated, and he wants to try and live in the moment A of stressing the future. He tries to be independent, realizing he can not depend on anyone else for his well-being. If he ever gets the chance, he would like to take a risk and start a business, but in the meantime, he spends his time playing soccer, basketball, fishing, and doing school work. His goal for the future is to not rely on technology so much, and he hopes the same for future generations. He feels the most loved on his birthday when all of his friends and family reach out and wish him well.`
